### MCP Lifecycle – Three Main Phases

MCP uses a clear **three-step process** when a client (like an AI app) talks to a server (like a tool host):

1. **Initialization**
2. **Operation**
3. **Shutdown**

#### 1. Initialization

* This is **always the first step**.
* The **client** starts by sending an `initialize` message that includes:

  * The **protocol version** it supports.
  * A list of **its capabilities** (what it can do).
  * Some **info about itself** (like its name and version).
* The **server** replies with its own:

  * Protocol version.
  * Its own capabilities (like support for prompts, tools, resources).
  * Its information (name, version).
* Finally, the client sends a **"notifications/initialized"** message.

  * This tells the server: “I’m all set—ready to talk!”
* Only after this step can normal communication begin.
  ([Model Context Protocol][1], [Medium][2])

#### 2. Operation

* This is when the real work happens.
* The client and server **talk with each other**, following the features each said they're ready to support:

  * Client can ask to call **tools**, use **prompts**, load **resources**, etc.
  * Both sides must **stick to what they agreed upon** in initialization.
* They may also send small **ping messages** to check if the connection is still alive.
  ([Composio][3], [arXiv][4])

#### 3. Shutdown

* When the client or server is done, they **end the connection cleanly**.
* The method depends on how they’re connected:

  * If using **stdio** (local pipes), the client closes its input, waits a bit, maybe sends a `SIGTERM` signal, and eventually a `SIGKILL` if needed.
  * If using **HTTP**, closing the connection is enough.
    ([Innoq][5], [Composio][3])
* During shutdown, they should finish any work, clean up resources, and stop sending messages.
  ([arXiv][4], [Medium][6])

### Quick Recap Table

| Phase              | Simple Description                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Initialization** | Starting phase. Client and server say hello, check compatibility, and agree on what they can do. |
| **Operation**      | Main conversation. Client and server use features they agreed on to work together.               |
| **Shutdown**       | Ending phase. Close connection cleanly when work is done.                                        |

### Why This Matters

* **Keeps communication safe and reliable**. Both sides know what the other can do.
* **Avoids errors** like using features before agreeing on them.
* **Helps clean up** properly when done, preventing resource waste or errors.
