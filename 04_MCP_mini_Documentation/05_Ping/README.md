## 🛠 What is MCP Ping?

Ping is just a **“hello, are you still there?”** check between **client** and **server**.
It’s used to make sure the connection is still alive.

## 🔄 How it works

1. Client or server sends a **ping request** → "hey, are you alive?"

   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "id": "123",
     "method": "ping"
   }
   ```

2. The other side must reply quickly with an **empty response** → "yes, I’m alive."

   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "id": "123",
     "result": {}
   }
   ```

## 📌 Rules (easy points)

* The reply must come **fast**.
* If no reply comes in time →

  * connection is considered **dead/stale** 🛑
  * sender can **close it** and try **reconnect** 🔄

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Example

Imagine you and your friend are on a phone call 📞.

* Every 5 minutes you say: *“Hello? Can you hear me?”*
* If your friend replies: *“Yes”* → connection is good.
* If your friend doesn’t reply → you hang up and call again.

That’s exactly how **ping** works in MCP.

## ⚡ Usage & Tips

* You **should** send pings **sometimes** to check health.
* How often? → depends on network (not too many, or waste of internet).
* If many pings fail → reset the connection.
* Always log ping failures (so you know what went wrong).

👉 So in **1 line**:
**MCP Ping = a small “are you alive?” check between client & server to keep connection healthy.** ✅
