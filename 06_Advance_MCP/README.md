# ‚ö° MCP Features in Stateless vs Stateful

## 1. üå≥ Roots

* **What it is:** Roots = server‚Äôs ‚Äúdirectory‚Äù (tools, resources, prompts). Client uses them to know what server can do.
* **Stateless (True):**

  * Roots must be re-fetched every time a client connects.
  * No updates remembered between requests.
  * ‚úÖ Advantage: Very simple, no session storage.
  * ‚ùå Disadvantage: Extra network calls, no persistent updates.
* **Stateful (False):**

  * Roots are stored in session.
  * If server updates roots, client can be notified without re-fetch.
  * ‚úÖ Advantage: Efficient for long-lived clients, dynamic updates.
  * ‚ùå Disadvantage: Needs session management (slightly more complex).
* **Best for:**

  * Stateless ‚Üí simple one-off clients.
  * Stateful ‚Üí long-lived apps (e.g. IDE plugins).

---

## 2. üé≤ Sampling

* **What it is:** Server may sample model outputs or behaviors.
* **Stateless:**

  * Each sampling call is independent.
  * No memory of previous samples.
  * ‚úÖ Advantage: Predictable, safe for APIs.
  * ‚ùå Disadvantage: Cannot build multi-turn sampling sessions.
* **Stateful:**

  * Sampling can be chained across turns in a session.
  * ‚úÖ Advantage: Context-aware sampling (useful for chatbots, multi-step inference).
  * ‚ùå Disadvantage: Requires server to keep session state.
* **Best for:**

  * Stateless ‚Üí one-shot completions.
  * Stateful ‚Üí conversational or iterative tasks.

---

## 3. üß© Elicitation

* **What it is:** Asking client for additional input (like "give me username").
* **Stateless:**

  * Harder, because there‚Äôs no ongoing session.
  * Each elicitation must restart context.
  * ‚úÖ Advantage: Simple prompt-response APIs.
  * ‚ùå Disadvantage: No smooth back-and-forth.
* **Stateful:**

  * Natural multi-step elicitation supported (server can ask, client can answer).
  * ‚úÖ Advantage: Great for interactive apps and agents.
  * ‚ùå Disadvantage: More complexity in error recovery.
* **Best for:**

  * Stateless ‚Üí quick, single questions.
  * Stateful ‚Üí conversational workflows.

---

## 4. üìú Logging

* **What it is:** Server sends logs (debug, info, error, etc.).
* **Stateless:**

  * Logging is limited. Each request has only local logs.
  * No continuous log stream.
  * ‚úÖ Advantage: Very light overhead.
  * ‚ùå Disadvantage: Can‚Äôt see history of logs.
* **Stateful:**

  * Persistent logging channel per session.
  * ‚úÖ Advantage: Full history + real-time updates.
  * ‚ùå Disadvantage: Requires session ID & tracking.
* **Best for:**

  * Stateless ‚Üí small, simple services.
  * Stateful ‚Üí debugging, long-lived apps, monitoring.

---

## 5. üìà Progress

* **What it is:** Server reports progress of a long-running task (like training or file upload).
* **Stateless:**

  * Very limited. Since no session, progress updates are lost after request ends.
  * ‚úÖ Advantage: Works for short tasks (just return final result).
  * ‚ùå Disadvantage: Can‚Äôt stream progress (e.g. 30%, 60%, done).
* **Stateful:**

  * Progress events tied to session.
  * ‚úÖ Advantage: Client gets updates as they happen.
  * ‚ùå Disadvantage: Needs session channel to stay open.
* **Best for:**

  * Stateless ‚Üí only short or atomic jobs.
  * Stateful ‚Üí long-running jobs (training, downloads, indexing).

# üèÜ Summary Table

| Feature     | Stateless ‚úÖ               | Stateful ‚úÖ                 | Best Use Case           |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Roots       | Yes (re-fetch every time) | Yes (persistent + updates) | Stateful for IDE/tools  |
| Sampling    | Yes (one-shot)            | Yes (multi-turn)           | Stateful for agents     |
| Elicitation | Yes (basic Q/A)           | Yes (multi-step dialogs)   | Stateful for workflows  |
| Logging     | Yes (per call)            | Yes (continuous stream)    | Stateful for monitoring |
| Progress    | Yes (only final)          | Yes (stream updates)       | Stateful for long tasks |

---

# üéØ Which One is Better?

* **Stateless:**

  * Best when you want **simplicity**, low server cost, one-off requests.
  * Example: REST APIs, serverless calls.

* **Stateful:**

  * Best when you need **interaction, progress tracking, logging, or multi-turn context**.
  * Example: IDE plugins, chat assistants, training dashboards.

---

üëâ So, all five (Roots, Sampling, Elicitation, Logging, Progress) **work in both** modes.
But **stateful makes them powerful**, while **stateless keeps them lightweight**.
