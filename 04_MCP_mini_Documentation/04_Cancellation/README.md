### 🔹 What is Cancellation in MCP?

Cancellation means **stopping a request that is already running**.
Like pressing the **"Cancel" button** when something is loading.

### 🔹 How does it work?

* If the **Client** (user side) or **Server** (AI side) sends a request (like “fetch resources”), it might take time.
* If we don’t need it anymore, we can send a **cancel message**.
* That tells the other side: **“Stop working on this request, I don’t need it.”**

---

### 🔹 What does the cancel message look like?

It’s a **notification** (not a request-response). Example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/cancelled",
  "params": {
    "requestId": "123",
    "reason": "User requested cancellation"
  }
}
```

* `requestId` → The ID of the request we want to cancel
* `reason` → (Optional) Why we are cancelling

### 🔹 Rules of Cancellation (Easy points)

1. ✅ You can **only cancel requests that are still running**.
2. 🚫 You **cannot cancel the `initialize` request** (startup process).
3. ✅ The side that receives the cancel should:

   * Stop working on it
   * Free memory/resources
   * Not send back a reply
4. ⚠️ If the cancel arrives too late (because of network delay), the request might already be finished. In that case:

   * Just ignore it (no error).
5. ✅ If a response comes **after cancel**, ignore it.

### 🔹 Example in Real Life

Imagine ordering food online 🍔.

* You place the order (request).
* Before the restaurant starts cooking, you call them and cancel (cancel notification).
* If they already cooked the food, cancellation may be too late → they just ignore your cancel request.

---

### 🔹 Why is this important?

* Saves **time** ⏳ (don’t process things we don’t need).
* Saves **resources** 💻 (CPU, memory).
* Makes the system more **responsive** to user actions.

👉 So in simple words:
**MCP Cancellation is a way for client or server to stop a running request by sending a cancel notification with the request ID. If it’s too late, just ignore it.**
