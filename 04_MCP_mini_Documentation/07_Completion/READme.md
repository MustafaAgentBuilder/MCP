# 🟢 What is Completion in MCP?

**Think of it like **autofill / autocomplete** when you type something.**

👉 In MCP:

* **Client** = where user types (like VS Code, or a chat app).
* **Server** = provides smart suggestions.

Example:
If you type `py`, the server might suggest:

```
python, pytorch, pyside
```

So the user doesn’t have to type the whole thing!

# 🟢 How it Works (Step by Step)

1. **Server declares capability**
   It says “Hey, I support completions” during startup:

   ```json
   {
     "capabilities": {
       "completions": {}
     }
   }
   ```

2. **User starts typing something**
   Example: User types `py` for programming language.

3. **Client sends request to server**

   ```json
   {
     "method": "completion/complete",
     "params": {
       "ref": { "type": "ref/prompt", "name": "code_review" },
       "argument": { "name": "language", "value": "py" }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Server replies with suggestions**

   ```json
   {
     "completion": {
       "values": ["python", "pytorch", "pyside"],
       "total": 10,
       "hasMore": true
     }
   }
   ```

   * `values` → the actual suggestions
   * `total` → total possible matches
   * `hasMore` → true if more results exist

# 🟢 Example with Context

Sometimes, one answer depends on another.

Example:

* First argument = language = `python`
* Next argument = framework = `fla`

Request:

```json
{
  "ref": { "type": "ref/prompt", "name": "code_review" },
  "argument": { "name": "framework", "value": "fla" },
  "context": { "arguments": { "language": "python" } }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "completion": {
    "values": ["flask"],
    "total": 1,
    "hasMore": false
  }
}
```

---

# 🟢 Two Kinds of References

* `ref/prompt` → Suggestions for prompt arguments (like code\_review language).
* `ref/resource` → Suggestions for resources (like file paths or URIs).

---

# 🟢 Easy Analogy

Imagine you’re typing in Google search:

* You type `py`
* Google suggests `python`, `pytorch`, `pygame`

That’s **MCP Completion** — but instead of search, it’s inside **tools, prompts, or file paths**.

---

👉 In short:
**Completion makes MCP smart by suggesting things while you type.**
It’s like autocomplete in code editors, search bars, or forms.
